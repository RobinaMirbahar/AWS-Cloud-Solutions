Use a GraphQL query template literal to define the subscription query:

const subscribeDoc = `
subscription SubscribeToChannel($name: String!) {
    subscribe(name: $name) {
        data
        name
    }
}
`;

Instead of using Javascrtipt 

const subscribeDoc = 
subscription Subscribe($name: String!) {
    subscribe(name: $name) {
        data
        name
    }
}


This should properly define the subscription query and allow the API.graphql call to work as intended.
